{
    // Implement the update of the drone's state based on dynamics
    // This could include updating the position, velocity, and orientation using appropriate formulas
    // Update the state variables based on the provided time step
    // Add any additional logic required for the dynamics
    // For example:
    // position += velocity * timeStep;
    // velocity += acceleration * timeStep;
    // orientation += angularVelocity * timeStep;
    // Implement the necessary logic for translational and rotational dynamics
    // You can access and modify the private member variables of the Drone class here
    // Add any other necessary logic for the update
    // Remember to account for forces, torques, and other physical factors affecting the drone's motion
    // This is a simplified example; you may need to incorporate more complex dynamics and control algorithms
    // based on your specific requirements and desired level of accuracy
    // You can also include other member functions in the Drone class as per your needs
